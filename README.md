Description: YouTubeTranscriptAnalyzer is a Python-based project designed to analyze YouTube video transcripts for specific keywords. It utilizes the YouTube Data API v3 to fetch the video captions and extract the transcript. By providing a YouTube video ID and a list of keywords, the program counts the occurrences of each keyword in the transcript.

How to Use:

1. Obtain a YouTube Data API key by following the instructions provided by Google.
2. Set the obtained API key in the api_key variable in the code.
3. Specify the YouTube video ID you want to analyze by replacing "YOUR_VIDEO_ID" with the actual video ID.
4. Define the keywords you want to search for in the keywords list.
5. Run the Python script.
6. The program will retrieve the transcript for the specified video and analyze it for keyword counts.

Please note that the code snippets assume the presence of necessary API keys and packages. Make sure to replace "YOUR_API_KEY", "YOUR_VIDEO_ID", "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID" with the appropriate values before running the code.
