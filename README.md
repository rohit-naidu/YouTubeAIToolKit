# YouTubeTranscriptAnalyzer
YouTubeTranscriptAnalyzer is a Python-based project designed to analyze YouTube video transcripts for specific keywords. It utilizes the YouTube Data API v3 to fetch the video captions and extract the transcript. By providing a YouTube video ID and a list of keywords, the program counts the occurrences of each keyword in the transcript.
